# Stroke Prediction Project  

## 📄 Overview  
This project focuses on predicting strokes using the **Stroke Prediction Kaggle Dataset**. The dataset contains demographic and health-related information, such as age, gender, BMI, and smoking status, which serve as predictors.  

The goal is to build a robust machine learning pipeline by preprocessing the data, handling outliers, engineering features, managing class imbalance, and training predictive models. Additionally, we will use visualizations to gain insights into the data and model performance.

## 🚀 Features of the Project  

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing  
- Handle missing values (e.g., BMI).  
- Encode categorical variables like gender and smoking status.  
- Standardize or normalize numerical features such as BMI and glucose levels.  

### 🔹 Outlier Detection  
- Use methods like **Interquartile Range (IQR)** to detect anomalies.  
- Visualize outliers with **box plots** and decide whether to treat or remove them.  

### 🔹 Feature Engineering  
- Create new features such as interaction terms between BMI and smoking status.  
- Group continuous features like age into bins.  
- Perform feature selection to identify the most important predictors.  

### 🔹 Handling Imbalance  
- Check the target variable distribution.  
- Address imbalance with techniques like:  
  - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**.  
  - **Undersampling the majority class**.  

### 🔹 Visualization  
Gain insights into data and results with visualizations:  
- Distributions of age, BMI, and glucose levels.  
- Correlation heatmaps to understand feature relationships.  
- Target variable distribution to highlight class imbalance.  
- Feature importance plots using SHAP or other techniques.

### 🔹 Predictive Modeling  
- Train and evaluate machine learning models, including:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost   
- Evaluate models using metrics such as:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score  
  - ROC-AUC
